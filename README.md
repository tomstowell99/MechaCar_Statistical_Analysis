### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which Variables/Coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the MPG?
    * Vehicle Length and Ground clearance had the most signifcant impact on MPG. Both have a p-value of less than .05, which is our cutoff to determine
      significance.
  
  Slope of the line.
  * Our slope is 5.35e-11. This idicates the slope is not 0. A slope not equal to 0. Indicates that are independent variables are some level of impact to the 
    dependent variable MPG>
    
  Does our linear model predict  mgp effectively?
  * Our R squared for the model was .7149. An indication that our model is 71% accurate. We additional variable I am confidentwe could improve this model.
    Using Engine size and fuel type for example.
